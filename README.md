# Cover and adaption parts for the POTY ("Patch of the Year") QO-100 feed
These are cover and adaption parts (40mm to 22mm ring for the LNB mount and a POTY to LNB waveguide adaption) for the POTY QO-100 feed (thanks to Mike Willis G0MJW, Remco den Besten PA3FYM and Paul Marsh M0EYT for this great design and their great work).

The parts are for a (kit) design available e.g. at [Hans Holsink PE1CKK](http://www.hybridpretender.nl/poty.html), [Passion-Radio](https://www.passion-radio.com/satellite/poty-antenna-762.html) or [IBJ](https://ibj-shop.com/POTY-Planarantenne-fuer-QO-100).

I printed the parts with black PLA and white ABS with 0,2mm layer height/0,4mm nozzle and they fit well. The final version is made of ABS, because it is UV- and shock-resistant and has good RF characteristics.
Be aware to retune the patch *with* cover (it has an obvious influence!).
The adaptor ring can be cut on one side. I used a bit of adhesive tape to support the other side, because if bended more than two times the material may break and you'll get two parts.

The parts are modeled with [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).
